# üì± Expo Go Setup Process

**Date:** July 10, 2025  
**Device:** Android

## ‚úÖ Steps I Followed

1. Visited the Expo Go page: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)
2. Selected the latest SDK version available.
3. Clicked **Install** for Android.
4. Downloaded the app from the **Google Play Store**.
5. Opened the **Expo Go** app.
6. Created a new account and logged in.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- The installed Expo CLI version was not compatible with my current **Node.js (v17+)** version.  
  ‚Üí **Fix:** Uninstalled the legacy `expo-cli` and used the new local Expo CLI following [this guide](https://blog.expo.dev/the-new-expo-cli-f4250d8e3421).
- Slight delay in Google Play Store loading.
